# Introduction
The inspiration for this project comes from my interests of woodworking and trying to build jigs for easier builds. 
I love watching walkthrough videos on Youtube by experienced woodworkers. The annoying part is that its difficult and time consuming to find good content.
As the developer I aim to create a webpage / forum for avid woodworkers that wish to share their skill with others.

# UX
 The site should be easy and intuitive to navigate. It should have a distinct design that is present on all content pages. Easy to use on both mobile and larger devices.

The forums should have a clear and easy to understand category system as well as easy and intuitive features to ask questions as well as to publish content. Forums should be seperate from sections where walkthroughs are published.

## User&nbsp;Stories
- The problem with most forums and youtube content is the difficulty to find quality. Most times I watch videos for minutes only to find that its garbage, either by the quality of content or that its impossible to hear what the woodworker is saying. I would appreciate a site that is easy to navigate and "easy" to find content that other viewers have given high ratings, for quality. Also I would like a feature that gives me as a consumer advice on equipment or the workshop. Not only premium but simply tools that are of good quality and a good buy.

# Features
- Registered users can upload content and post articles / questions.
- Guest users only have viewing rights.
- Content from experienced users seperated from forums that are about questions
- Users must register with valid credentials so as to be transparent and promote "good behaviour"
- Easy to upload files/pictures and videos. As well as linking to urls (youtube)
- A rating service so that good content is distinguished from mediocre.
- Easy to search for quality content, walkthroughs and specific keywords in

## Upcoming&nbsp;Features

- A webshop with tools and accessories (MS4, Django Fullstack)
- Ratings function that sorts search queries.

# Technologies&nbsp;Used

CSS styling was used by utilizing Bootstrap framework. The code snippets have been implemented from [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com).
Javascript was used for writing the logic behind the interactivity.
CKEditor was implemented for textarea funcionality.
Flask Framework and libraries for authentication, validation, forms
Google Icons CDN for all site icons.

## Expected&nbsp;Outcome
All site pages should load as expected. guest users should have the ability to view the site. Only registered and logged in users should be allowed to post content. Admin account to moderate content and suspend users. An 404 custom page for missing or invalid page requests.

## Bugs

### Initial report before submitting
I have not got it working as planned... I have most flask/python functionality written but not all. HAve spent to much time trying to figure out specific features, like the ratings. But have not got it working. I used MaterializeCSS in the beginning, as this evolved from the walktrough project. I have however switched to Bootstrap due to difficulties getting the desired effects.. I spent way too much time trying to get the navbar and sidenav (which I have scrapped) to work as I intended.

I have deployed it to Heroku earlier in development and got it working. However, as of 11.30 I find out I have an error when viewing site through Heroku...

I have used Stackoverflow extensively during the Javascript parts of the course.
The Code Institute walkthrough with Tim Nelson was the foundation to this course
Corey Schafer and his Tutorial series on Flask was a great help https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/videos
